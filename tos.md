# 2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

In the course of operating our Services, we may collect a wide range of information, which includes:

- **Cookies and Tracking Technologies:** We use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your interactions with our Website. This information is used for essential site functionality, session management, and to preserve your preferences. This may include cookies that store your login state for our website or other connected services.
- **Third-Party Platform Data:** When you interact with our Services through third-party platforms such as BYOND, Discord, or Twitch, we may collect information provided to us by those platforms as part of their standard API or service functionality.

# 3. BASIS FOR AND PURPOSE OF DATA USE

Our processing of your personal information is for the legitimate interest of operating, maintaining, and moderating our community and Services. We do not use your data for commercial analytics, marketing, or to sell to any third party.

The purposes for which we use your information are:

- **Provision and Operation of Services:** To operate, maintain, and provide the full functionality of the Game, Website, and all connected Services.

# 4. DATA SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

We do not sell, rent, lease, or trade your personal information. Your information is disclosed only in the following limited circumstances:

- **Third-Party Service Providers:** Your information is inherently processed by the third-party platforms you use to access our Services (e.g., BYOND, Discord, Twitch) and by our infrastructure providers (e.g., our servers or Website hosts). We do not control the privacy practices of these third parties.
- **Authorized Volunteer Staff:** Our authorized volunteer administrators and moderators may be granted access to your personal information (such as logs, IP addresses, and hardware identifiers) strictly as necessary to perform their moderation and administrative duties in accordance with our internal policies.
- **Legal Compliance and Protection:** We may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.

# 5. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

We implement reasonable administrative and technical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We store data on secure servers, primarily located in the United States. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
